# Troubleshooting
Use the following checklist to diagnose problems using the SupportPac.

1. The SupportPac will issue the CICS abend CA1Y if it is started as a custom event adapter and the event could not be emitted.
* Ensure the steps listed under [Installation](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-event-consumer/blob/master/README.md#installation) were followed.
* If starting the SupportPac as a CICS event adapter, ensure that CICS event processing is enabled and the event is being captured. To view the status of event processing and the number of captured events, use the CICS Explorer views available in the CICS SM perspective, under menu Operations → Event Processing.
* Review the contents of the JVM server stderr and stdout files. <br> For example if the mail server could not be reached there will likely be javax.mail.MessagingException entries with further exception information and a backtrace.
* Review the contents of the OSGi framework log files, as described in [Diagnostics for Java](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.java.doc/topics/dfhpjei.html). Verify the JavaMail API bundle mail.jar or javax.mail.jar and SupportPac bundle com.ibm.cics.ca1y_1.8.0.jar are installed.
* Enable [Java Logging](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/logging/overview.html) for the package com.ibm.cics.ca1y. See [Logging](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-event-consumer/blob/master/README.md#logging).
* If there are issues transforming XML using an XML stylesheet, check the output from JAXP by adding the following to the JVM server profile, disable and enable the JVMSERVER, then attempt to resend the email: `‑Djaxp.debug=1`
* Ensure the TCP/IP stack on the LPAR in which the SupportPac is running is able to reach the target SMTP server and there are no firewalls that block access. <br> For example, log onto z/OS with telnet and use: `traceroute <mail_server_hostname>`
* Once the SupportPac prepares the email it uses the JavaMail API to interact with the mail server. You may therefore find useful diagnostic information in the [JAVAMAIL API FAQ](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-135477.html).
* Check the email is not being removed as junk by your email provider.
* If the Java stderr contains javax.mail.MessagingException: Could not connect to SMTP host: localhost, port: 25 then it is likely the mail server properties are not defined or being imported correctly. Check the encoding of the file is the same as that used on the file token. <br> For example, if the file is stored at `/usr/lpp/ca1y/examples/emailServer.properties` in EBCDIC codepage 1047, the event adapter configuration should import the properties with: <br> `import={file=/usr/lpp/ca1y/examples/emailServer.properties: encoding=Cp1047}`
* If the Java stderr contains java.io.FileNotFoundException: File '/usr/lpp/ca1y/examples/emailServer.properties' does not exist then it is likely the file does not exist, or the file or directory permissions are not set correctly. Note that the directory needs to have execute bit on for files to be read.
* Check the site SupportPac CA1Y for later versions that may contain fixes to your issue.
* Email the SupportPac author for guidance – see Error: Reference source not found on page Error: Reference source not found.
* If you are having issues creating a Java regular expression, as used in the property token.regex and tokens htmltable and texttable, you may find site http://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/java/index.html useful to try and evaluate expressions.
